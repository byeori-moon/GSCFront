## UN's Sustainable Development 
Goal 11. Sustainable Cities and Communities

## Problem
1. Not Paying Attention to Fire Risks: A lot of people don’t realize how everyday actions and oversights can lead to serious fire hazards. Things like plugging too many devices into one outlet, not storing things safely, or forgetting to check if fire safety gear works properly are common mistakes. Many think, "A fire won’t happen to me," and end up ignoring basic safety steps.

2. Rethinking Fire Safety Education: The current approach to fire safety education often delivers information that is not directly applicable to the specific environments in which we live or work. This lack of personalized and relevant content makes it difficult for individuals to truly grasp the importance of fire safety or to envision how to implement these practices in their daily lives. To address this issue, there's a pressing need to shift from a one-size-fits-all method of instruction to a more interactive and engaging educational model. 

3. Not Looking for Information on Fire Safety: People generally don’t make an effort to learn fire safety knowledge by their own will. Since many think a fire is unlikely to happen to them, they don’t see the point in spending time on this topic. Even when helpful tips and information are easy to find, they're often ignored. This attitude stops important safety information from getting to the people who need it most and makes them less prepared for fire risks around them.

## Solution
Our Solution addresses the issue of underestimating fire risks due to a lack of fire safety awareness and preparedness. By transforming the perception of fire from a distant to a daily concern, we aim to heighten awareness of fire hazards and provide knowledge for appropriate responses.

Key features:
1. Camera-based Detection of nearby fire hazards (top 7 items that started the fire the most; data from the National Fire Information System as of last year).
